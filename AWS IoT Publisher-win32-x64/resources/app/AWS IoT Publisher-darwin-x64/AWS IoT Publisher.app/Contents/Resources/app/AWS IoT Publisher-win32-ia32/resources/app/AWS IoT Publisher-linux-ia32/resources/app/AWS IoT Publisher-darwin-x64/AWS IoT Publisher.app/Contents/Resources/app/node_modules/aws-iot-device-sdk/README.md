# AWS IoT SDK for Node.js
The aws-iot-device-sdk.js package allows developers to write JavaScript 
applications which access the AWS IoT Platform; it is intended for use in
embedded devices which support Node.js, but it can be used in other Node.js 
environments as well.

## Overview
This document provides instructions on how to install and configure the AWS 
IoT device SDK for Node.js and includes examples demonstrating use of the
SDK APIs.

### MQTT Connection
This package is built on top of [mqtt.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md) and provides two classes: 'device'
and 'thingShadow'.  The 'device' class wraps [mqtt.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md) to provide a
secure connection to the AWS IoT platform and expose the [mqtt.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md) interfaces
upward via an instance of the mqtt client.

### Thing Shadows
The 'thingShadow' class implements additional functionality for accessing Thing Shadows via the AWS IoT
API; the thingShadow class allows devices to update, be notified of changes to,
get the current state of, or delete Thing Shadows from AWS IoT.  Thing
Shadows allow applications and devices to synchronize their state on the AWS IoT platform.
For example, a remote device can update its Thing Shadow in AWS IoT, allowing
a user to view the device's last reported state via a mobile app.  The user
can also update the device's Thing Shadow in AWS IoT and the remote device 
will synchronize with the new state.  The 'thingShadow' class supports multiple 
Thing Shadows per mqtt connection and allows pass-through of non-Thing-Shadow
topics and mqtt events.

## Examples

### Device Class
```js
var awsIot = require('aws-iot-device-sdk');

var device = awsIot.device({
   keyPath: '~/awsCerts/private.pem.key',
  certPath: '~/awsCerts/certificate.pem.crt',
    caPath: '~/awsCerts/root-CA.crt',
  clientId: 'myAwsClientId',
    region: 'us-east-1'
});

//
// Device is an instance returned by mqtt.Client(), see mqtt.js for full
// documentation.
//
device
  .on('connect', function() {
    console.log('connect');
    device.subscribe('topic_1');
    device.publish('topic_2', JSON.stringify({ test_data: 1}));
    });

device
  .on('message', function(topic, payload) {
    console.log('message', topic, payload.toString());
  });
```
### Thing Shadow Class
```js
var awsIot = require('aws-iot-device-sdk');

var thingShadows = awsIot.thingShadow({
   keyPath: '~/awsCerts/private.pem.key',
  certPath: '~/awsCerts/certificate.pem.crt',
    caPath: '~/awsCerts/root-CA.crt',
  clientId: 'myAwsClientId',
    region: 'us-east-1'
});

//
// Client token value returned from thingShadows.update() operation
//
var clientTokenUpdate;

//
// Simulated device values
//
var rval = 187;
var gval = 114;
var bval = 222;

thingShadows.on('connect', function() {
//
// After connecting to the AWS IoT platform, register interest in the
// Thing Shadow named 'RGBLedLamp'.
//
    thingShadows.register( 'RGBLedLamp' );
//
// 5 seconds after registering, update the Thing Shadow named 
// 'RGBLedLamp' with the latest device state and save the clientToken
// so that we can correlate it with status or timeout events.
//
// Note that the delay is not required for subsequent updates; only
// the first update after a Thing Shadow registration using default
// parameters requires a delay.  See API documentation for the update
// method for more details.
//
    setTimeout( function() {
//
// Thing shadow state
//
       var rgbLedLampState = {"state":{"desired":{"red":rval,"green":gval,"blue":bval}}};

       clientTokenUpdate = thingShadows.update('RGBLedLamp', rgbLedLampState  );
//
// The update method returns a clientToken; if non-null, this value will
// be sent in a 'status' event when the operation completes, allowing you
// to know whether or not the update was successful.  If the update method
// returns null, it's because another operation is currently in progress and
// you'll need to wait until it completes (or times out) before updating the 
// shadow.
//
       if (clientTokenUpdate === null)
       {
          console.log('update shadow failed, operation still in progress');
       }
       }, 5000 );
    });

thingShadows.on('status', 
    function(thingName, stat, clientToken, stateObject) {
       console.log('received '+stat+' on '+thingName+': '+
                   JSON.stringify(stateObject));
//
// These events report the status of update(), get(), and delete() 
// calls.  The clientToken value associated with the event will have
// the same value which was returned in an earlier call to get(),
// update(), or delete().  Use status events to keep track of the
// status of shadow operations.
//
    });

thingShadows.on('delta', 
    function(thingName, stateObject) {
       console.log('received delta on '+thingName+': '+
                   JSON.stringify(stateObject));
    });

thingShadows.on('timeout',
    function(thingName, clientToken) {
       console.log('received timeout on '+thingName+
                   ' with token: '+ clientToken);
//
// In the event that a shadow operation times out, you'll receive
// one of these events.  The clientToken value associated with the
// event will have the same value which was returned in an earlier
// call to get(), update(), or delete().
//
    });

<a name="device"></a>
### awsIot.device(options)

Returns an instance of the [mqtt.Client()](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#client) 
class, configured for a TLS connection with the AWS IoT platform and with 
arguments as specified in `options`.  The AWSIoT-specific arguments are as 
follows:

  * `region`: the AWS IoT region you will operate in (default 'us-east-1')
  * `clientId`: the client ID you will use to connect to AWS IoT
  * `certPath`: path of the client certificate file
  * `keyPath`: path of the private key file associated with the client certificate
  * `caPath`: path of your CA certificate file 
  * `clientCert`: same as `certPath`, but can also accept a buffer containing client certificate data
  * `privateKey`: same as `keyPath`, but can also accept a buffer containing private key data
  * `caCert`: same as `caPath`, but can also accept a buffer containing CA certificate data
  * `protocol`: the connection type, either 'mqtts' (default) or 'wss' (WebSocket/TLS)

All certificates and keys must be in PEM format.

`options` also contains arguments specific to mqtt.  See [the mqtt client documentation]
(https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#client) for details 
of these arguments.

Supports all events emitted by the [mqtt.Client()](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#client) class.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="thingShadow"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow(options)

The `thingShadow` class wraps an instance of the `device` class with additional
functionality to operate on Thing Shadows via the AWS IoT API.  The
arguments in `options` include all those in the [device class](#device), with 
the addition of the following arguments specific to the `thingShadow` class:

* `operationTimeout`: the timeout for thing operations (default 30 seconds)
* `postSubscribeTimeout`: the time to wait after subscribing to an operation's sub-topics prior to publishing on the operation's topic (default 2.2 seconds)

Supports all events emitted by the [mqtt.Client()](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#client) class; however, the semantics for the 
`message` event are slightly different and additional events are available
as described below:

### Event `'message'`

`function(topic, message) {}`

Emitted when a message is received on a topic not related to any Thing Shadows:
* `topic` topic of the received packet
* `message` payload of the received packet

### Event `'status'`

`function(thingName, stat, clientToken, stateObject) {}`

Emitted when an operation `update|get|delete` completes.
* `thingName` name of the Thing Shadow for which the operation has completed
* `stat` status of the operation `accepted|rejected`
* `clientToken` the operation's clientToken
* `stateObject` the stateObject returned for the operation

Applications can use clientToken values to correlate status events with the
operations that they are associated with by saving the clientTokens returned
from each operation.

### Event `'delta'`

`function(thingName, stateObject) {}`

Emitted when a delta has been received for a registered Thing Shadow.
* `thingName` name of the Thing Shadow that has received a delta
* `stateObject` the stateObject returned for the operation

### Event `'timeout'`

`function(thingName, clientToken) {}`

Emitted when an operation `update|get|delete` has timed out.
* `thingName` name of the Thing Shadow that has received a timeout
* `clientToken` the operation's clientToken

Applications can use clientToken values to correlate timeout events with the
operations that they are associated with by saving the clientTokens returned
from each operation.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="register"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#register(thingName, [options] )

Register interest in the Thing Shadow named `thingName`.  The thingShadow class will
subscribe to any applicable topics, and will fire events for the Thing Shadow
until [awsIot.thingShadow#unregister()](#unregister) is called with `thingName`.  `options`
can contain the following arguments to modify how this Thing Shadow is processed:

* `ignoreDeltas`: set to `true` to not subscribe to the `delta` sub-topic for this Thing Shadow; used in cases where the application is not interested in changes (e.g. update only.) (default `false`)
* `persistentSubscribe`: set to `false` to unsubscribe from all operation sub-topics while not performing an operation (default `true`)
* `discardStale`: set to `false` to allow receiving messages with old version numbers (default `true`)

The `persistentSubscribe` argument allows an application to get faster operation
responses at the expense of potentially receiving more irrelevant response
traffic (i.e., response traffic for other clients who have registered interest
in the same Thing Shadow).  When `persistentSubscribe` is set to `true` (the default),
`postSubscribeTimeout` is forced to 0 and the `thingShadow` class will publish
immediately on any update, get, or delete operation for this registered Thing Shadow.
When set to `false`, operation sub-topics are only subscribed to during the scope
of that operation; note that in this mode, update, get, and delete operations will 
be much slower; however, the application will be less likely to receive irrelevant
response traffic.

*Note that when `persistentSubscribe` is set to `true` (the default), you must wait the `postSubscribeTimeout` (default 2.2 seconds) between registering interest in the Thing Shadow and performing the first update to it.  After this time interval has expired, you can update the Thing Shadow without waiting.*

The `discardStale` argument allows applications to receive messages which have
obsolete version numbers.  This can happen when messages are received out-of-order;
applications which set this argument to `false` should use other methods to
determine how to treat the data (e.g. use a time stamp property to know how old/stale
it is).

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="unregister"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#unregister(thingName)

Unregister interest in the Thing Shadow named `thingName`.  The thingShadow class
will unsubscribe from all applicable topics and no more events will be fired
for `thingName`.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="update"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#update(thingName, stateObject)

Update the Thing Shadow named `thingName` with the state specified in the 
JavaScript object `stateObject`.  `thingName` must have been previously 
registered
using [awsIot.thingShadow#register()](#register).  The thingShadow class will subscribe
to all applicable topics and publish `stateObject` on the <b>update</b> sub-topic.

This function returns a `clientToken`, which is a unique value associated with
the update operation.  When a 'status' or 'timeout' event is emitted, 
the `clientToken` will be supplied as one of the parameters, allowing the 
application to keep track of the status of each operation.  The caller may
create their own `clientToken` value; if `stateObject` contains a `clientToken`
property, that will be used rather than the internally generated value.  Note
that it should be of atomic type (i.e. numeric or string).  This function
returns 'null' if an operation is already in progress.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="get"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#get(thingName, [clientToken])

Get the current state of the Thing Shadow named `thingName`, which must have
been previously registered using [awsIot.thingShadow#register()](#register).  The 
thingShadow class will subscribe to all applicable topics and publish on the 
<b>get</b> sub-topic.

This function returns a `clientToken`, which is a unique value associated with
the get operation.  When a 'status or 'timeout' event is emitted, 
the `clientToken` will be supplied as one of the parameters, allowing the 
application to keep track of the status of each operation.  The caller may
supply their own `clientToken` value (optional); if supplied, the value of
`clientToken` will be used rather than the internally generated value.  Note
that this value should be of atomic type (i.e. numeric or string).  This
function returns 'null' if an operation is already in progress.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="delete"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#delete(thingName, [clientToken])

Delete the Thing Shadow named `thingName`, which must have been previously
registered using [awsIot.thingShadow#register()](#register).  The thingShadow class
will subscribe to all applicable topics and publish on the <b>delete</b>
sub-topic.

This function returns a `clientToken`, which is a unique value associated with
the delete operation.  When a 'status' or 'timeout' event is emitted, 
the `clientToken` will be supplied as one of the parameters, allowing the 
application to keep track of the status of each operation.  The caller may
supply their own `clientToken` value (optional); if supplied, the value of
`clientToken` will be used rather than the internally generated value.  Note
that this value should be of atomic type (i.e. numeric or string).  This
function returns 'null' if an operation is already in progress.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="publish"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#publish(topic, message, [options], [callback])

Identical to the [mqtt.Client#publish()](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#publish) 
method, with the restriction that the topic may not represent a Thing Shadow.
This method allows the user to publish messages to topics on the same connection
used to access Thing Shadows.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="subscribe"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#subscribe(topic, [options], [callback])

Identical to the [mqtt.Client#subscribe()](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#subscribe) 
method, with the restriction that the topic may not represent a Thing Shadow.
This method allows the user to subscribe to messages from topics on the same 
connection used to access Thing Shadows.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="unsubscribe"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#unsubscribe(topic, [options], [callback])

Identical to the [mqtt.Client#unsubscribe()](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#unsubscribe) 
method, with the restriction that the topic may not represent a Thing Shadow.
This method allows the user to unsubscribe from topics on the same 
used to access Thing Shadows.

-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="end"></a>
### awsIot.thingShadow#end([force], [callback])

Invokes the [mqtt.Client#end()](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#end) 
method on the MQTT connection owned by the `thingShadow` class.  The `force` 
and `callback` parameters are optional and identical in function to the 
parameters in the [mqtt.Client#end()](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/blob/master/README.md#end) method.

<a name="connections"></a>
## Connection Types

This SDK supports two types of connections to the AWS IoT platform:

* MQTT over TLS with mutual certificate authentication using port 8883
* MQTT over WebSocket/TLS with SigV4 authentication using port 443

The default connection type is MQTT over TLS with mutual certificate authentication; to
configure a WebSocket/TLS connection, set the `protocol` option to `wss` when instantiating
the [awsIot.device()](#device) or [awsIot.thingShadow()](#thingShadow) classes.

<a name="programs"></a>
## Example Programs

The 'examples' directory contains several programs which demonstrate usage
of the AWS IoT APIs:

* device-example.js: demonstrate simple MQTT publish and subscribe 
operations.

* [echo-example.js](#echoExample): test Thing Shadow operation by echoing all delta 
state updates to the update topic; used in conjunction with the [AWS
IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot) to verify connectivity 
with the AWS IoT platform.

* thing-example.js: use a Thing Shadow to automatically synchronize
state between a simulated device and a control application.

* thing-passthrough-example.js: demonstrate use of a Thing Shadow with
pasthrough of standard MQTT publish and subscribe messages.

* temperature-control/temperature-control.js: an interactive device simulation which uses
Thing Shadows.

The example programs use command line parameters to set options.  To see
the available options, run the program and specify the '-h' option as
follows:

```sh
node examples/<EXAMPLE-PROGRAM> -h
```
<a name="websockets"></a>
### WebSocket Configuration 

The example programs can be configured to use a WebSocket/TLS connection to
the AWS IoT platform by adding '--protocol=wss' to the command line to
override the default setting of 'mqtts'.

```sh
  -P, --protocol=PROTOCOL          connect using PROTOCOL (mqtts|wss)
```

When using a WebSocket/TLS connection, you'll need to set the following environment
variables:

```sh
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[a valid AWS access key ID]
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[a valid AWS secret access key]
```

The values of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` must contain valid
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials.  For more information about AWS
IAM, [visit the AWS IAM home page.](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)

<a name="certificates"></a>
### Certificate Configuration

When not configured to use a WebSocket/TLS connection, the example programs 
require a client certificate and private key (created using either the [AWS
IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot) or the 
[AWS IoT CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)) in order to authenticate with
AWS IoT.  Each example program uses command line options to specify the
names and/or locations of certificates as follows:

#### Specify a directory containing default-named certificates

```sh
  -f, --certificate-dir=DIR        look in DIR for certificates
```

The --certificate-dir (-f) option will read all certificate and key files from the
directory specified.  Default certificate/key file names are as follows:

* certificate.pem.crt: your AWS IoT certificate
* private.pem.key: the private key associated with your AWS IoT certificate
* root-CA.crt: the root CA certificate [(available from Symantec here)](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem)

#### Specify certificate names and locations individually

```sh
  -k, --private-key=FILE           use FILE as private key
  -c, --client-certificate=FILE    use FILE as client certificate
  -a, --ca-certificate=FILE        use FILE as CA certificate
```

The '-f' (certificate directory) option can be combined with these so that
you don't have to specify absolute pathnames for each file.

<a href="configurationFile></a>
#### Use a configuration file

The [AWS IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot) can generate JSON 
configuration data specifying the parameters required to connect a device
to the AWS IoT Platform.  The JSON configuration data includes pathnames
to certificates, the hostname and port number, etc...  The command line 
option '--configuration-file (-F)' is used when reading parameters from a
configuration file.

```sh
  -F, --configuration-file=FILE    use FILE (JSON format) for configuration
```

The configuration file is in JSON format, and may contain the following
properties:

* host - the host name to connect to
* port - the port number to use when connecting to the host (8883 for AWS IoT with client certificate)
* clientId - the client ID to use when connecting
* privateKey - file containing the private key
* clientCert - file containing the client certificate
* caCert - file containing the CA certificate
* thingName - thing name to use

##### Tips for using JSON configuration files
* _The '-f' (certificate directory) and '-F' (configuration file) options
can be combined so that you don't have to use absolute pathnames in the
configuration file._
* _When using a configuration file to run any of the example programs other 
than [echo-example.js](#echoExample), you **must** specify different client 
IDs for each process using the '-i' command line option._

### device-example.js

device-example.js is run as two processes which communicate with one
another via the AWS IoT platform using MQTT publish and subscribe.
The command line option '--test-mode (-t)' is used to set which role
each process performs.  It's easiest to run each process in its own
terminal window so that you can see the output generated by each.  Note
that in the following examples, all certificates are located in the
~/certs directory and have the default names as specified in the 
[Certificate Configuration section](#certificates).

#### _Terminal Window 1_
```sh
node examples/device-example.js -f ~/certs --test-mode=1
```

#### _Terminal Window 2_
```sh
node examples/device-example.js -f ~/certs --test-mode=2
```

### thing-example.js
Similar to device-example.js, thing-example.js is also run as two 
processes which communicate with one another via the AWS IoT platform.
thing-example.js uses a Thing Shadow to synchronize state between the
two processes, and the command line option '--test-mode (-t)' is used
to set which role each process performs.  As with device-example.js, 
it's best to run each process in its own terminal window or on separate
hosts.  In this example, the example programs are configured to use
WebSocket/TLS connections to the AWS IoT platform as specified in the
[WebSocket Configuration](#websockets).

#### _Terminal Window 1_
```sh
node examples/thing-example.js -P=wss --test-mode=1
```

#### _Terminal Window 2_
```sh
node examples/thing-example.js -P=wss --test-mode=2
```

### thing-passthrough-example.js
Similar to thing-example.js, thing-passthrough-example.js is also run 
as two processes which communicate with one another via the AWS IoT platform.
thing-passthrough-example.js uses a Thing Shadow to synchronize state
from one process to another, and uses MQTT publish/subscribe to send
information in the other direction.  The command line option '--test-mode (-t)'
is used to set which role each process performs.  As with thing-example.js, 
it's best to run each process in its own terminal window.  Note 
that in the following examples, all certificates are located in the
~/certs directory and have the default names as specified in the 
[Certificate Configuration section](#certificates).

#### _Terminal Window 1_
```sh
node examples/thing-passthrough-example.js -f ~/certs --test-mode=1
```

#### _Terminal Window 2_
```sh
node examples/thing-passthrough-example.js -f ~/certs --test-mode=2
```

<a name="echoExample"></a>
### echo-example.js
echo-example.js is used in conjunction with the 
[AWS IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot) to verify 
connectivity with the AWS IoT platform and to perform interactive 
observation of Thing Shadow operation.  In the following example, the
program is run using the configuration file '../config.json', and
the certificates are located in the '~/certs' directory.  Here, the
'-f' (certificate directory) and '-F' (configuration file) options
are combined so that the configuration file doesn't need to contain
absolute pathnames.

```sh
node examples/echo-example.js -F ../config.json -f ~/certs --thing-name testThing1
```

<a name="temp-control"></a>
### temperature-control.js
temperature-control.js is an interactive simulation which demonstrates
how Thing Shadows can be used to easily synchronize applications 
and internet-connected devices.  

Like thing-example.js, temperature-control.js runs in two
separate terminal windows and is configured via command-line options;
in the following example, all certificates are located in the ~/certs
directory and have the default names as specified in the 
[Certificate Configuration section](#certificates).  The process running
with '--test-mode=2' simulates an internet-connected temperature control 
device, and the process running with '--test-mode=1' simulates a mobile
application which is monitoring/controlling it.  The processes may be
run on different hosts if desired.

#### _Installing Dependencies_
temperature-control.js
uses the [blessed.js](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) and [blessed-contrib.js](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib) libraries to provide an 
interactive terminal interface; it looks best on an 80x25 terminal with a
black background and white or green text and requires UTF-8 character
encoding.  You'll need to install these libraries in the examples/temperature-control
directory as follows:

```sh
cd examples/temperature-control
npm install
```

#### _Running the Simulation - Terminal Window 1_
```sh
node examples/temperature-control/temperature-control.js -f ~/certs --test-mode=1
```
![temperature-control.js, 'mobile application' mode](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-supplemental/images/temperature-control-mobile-app-mode.png)

#### _Running the Simulation - Terminal Window 2_
```sh
node examples/temperature-control/temperature-control.js -f ~/certs --test-mode=2
```
![temperature-control.js, 'device' mode](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-supplemental/images/temperature-control-device-mode.png)

#### _Using the simulation_
The simulated temperature control device has two controls; _Setpoint_ and
_Status_.  _Status_ controls whether or not the device is active, and
_Setpoint_ controls the interior temperature the device will attempt to 
achieve.  In addition, the device reports the current interior and exterior
temperatures as well as its operating state (_heating_, _cooling_, or
_stopped_).

Two Thing Shadows are used to connect the simulated device and mobile
application; one contains the controls and the other contains the 
measured temperatures and operating state.  Both processes can update the
controls, but only the device can update the measured temperatures and
the operating state.

Controlling the simulation is done using the <kbd>up</kbd>, 
<kbd>down</kbd>, <kbd>left</kbd>, <kbd>right</kbd>, and 
<kbd>Enter</kbd> keys as follows:

* <kbd>up</kbd> increase the Setpoint
* <kbd>down</kbd> decrease the Setpoint
* <kbd>left</kbd> move left on the menu bar
* <kbd>right</kbd> move right on the menu bar
* <kbd>Enter</kbd> select the current menu option

##### Operating State

The operating state of the device is indicated by the color of the
Interior temperature field as follows:

* Red: _heating_
* Cyan: _cooling_
* White: _stopped_

The following example shows the temperature control simulation in 'device' mode
while the operating state is 'heating'.

##### Log

The log window displays events of interest, e.g. network connectivity,
_Status_ toggles, re-synchronization with the Thing Shadow, etc...

##### Menu Options

* Mode: Toggle the device _Status_.  _Status_ can be controlled from both
the simulated device and the mobile application.
* Network: Toggle the network connectivity of the device or mobile 
application; this can be used to observe how both sides re-synchronize 
when connectivity is restored.

In this example, the mobile application is disconnected from the network.  Although it has
requested that the Setpoint be lowered to 58 degrees, the command can't be sent to
the device as there is no network connectivity, so the operating state still shows as
'stopped'.  When the mobile application is reconnected to the network, it will attempt
to update the Thing Shadow for the device's controls; if no control changes have been
made on the device side during the disconnection period, the device will synchronize to
the mobile application's requested state; otherwise, the mobile application will re-
synchronize to the device's current state.

##### Exiting the Simulation

The simulation can be exited at any time by pressing <kbd>q</kbd>, 
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>, or by selecting 'exit' on the menu bar.

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems connecting to the AWS IoT Platform when using this SDK or
running the example programs, there are a few things to check:

* _Region Mismatch_:  If you didn't create your 
certificate in the default region ('us-east-1'), you'll need to specify 
the region (e.g., 'us-west-2') that you created your certificate in.  When
using the example programs, this can be done with the '-g' command line option.
* _Duplicate Client IDs_:  Within your AWS account, the AWS IoT platform
will only allow one connection per client ID.  Many of the example programs
run as two processes which communicate with one another.  If you don't
specify a client ID, the example programs will generate random client IDs,
but if you are using a [JSON configuration file](#configurationFile), you'll
need to explictly specify client IDs for both programs using the '-i' command
line option.
